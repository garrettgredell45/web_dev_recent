      here are sime lyrics to a song that I always play
      when attempting new things that confuse me
      </p>

      <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        Speak to me
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along

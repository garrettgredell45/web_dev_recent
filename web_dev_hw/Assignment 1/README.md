  <h2> Garrett Gredell<h2>

    <p> I am taking this class to learn how to do basic Web Design. The internet is a vast and continually growing resource. Almost anyone can contribute to the growing encyclopedia that is the internet. I think it is good to have basic knowledge of the internet and how to create websites in a world where people use it on a daily basis. Here are some things I recently learned about the internet;

    <ul>
      <li>The internet is NOT the web</li>
      <li>approximately 3.2 billion people use the net on a daily basis</li>
      <li> Bots create the majority of Internet traffic</li>

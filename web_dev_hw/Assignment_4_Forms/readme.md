<h1> Asignment 4: Forms<h1>

  Alt Text- a written element that is displayed, describing in specific detail what an image is should it fail to load for some reason. It's a good tool for accessibility.

  Examples of Forms I've encountered:
  <ul>
  <li>selecting info for residency</li>
  <li>payment info for online purchases</li>
  <li>Any sort of online survey</li>

  <u>Work Cycle:</u></br>
  I spent most of my time on this project trying to organize how I wanted to convey the information that would be in the forms portion of the page. There were seemingly quite a few ways to utulize all the form options to create a cohesive page. I used inspiration from actual camp registration sites (for layout) and tried to implement their ideas into this project. It definitely helped to have some sort of organized idea of what I wanted and likely saved me some time in the long run.

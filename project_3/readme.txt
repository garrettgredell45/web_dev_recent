# Project 3 README.md

This is my third project for web dev. This time I am focusing on
css and typography for web design. Most of the design ideas
were created in Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator first, before
being created with code. This helped me form my ideas easier since
I am much more fluent in the Adobe programs than I am with a text
editor and Github.

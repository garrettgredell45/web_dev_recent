This project is pretty difficult!
Spent a lot of time trying to memorize the tags
Had (still having) a few issues with the page that I need help
figuring out!
The font seems to all be the same size which sucks.
I managed to fix the list, previously it was all one paragraph with dots
in the middle and now its actually a list
Feels good though to be making progress with coding.
Managed to get all the source code thus far done in about 3 hours!!!
GO ME!

Spent a lot of time working with forms and tables
Had some troubles getting the table styling and I'm not sure how to really
incorporate the submit buttons. I'd like to make a link but I'm not sure how

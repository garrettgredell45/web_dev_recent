<p> This is the *most* basic course of all time, please <br />
  consider talking to a certified teacher before actually <br />
  riding a motorcycle :)

<p> Hello world, today I'd like to teach to you the basics<br />
  of riding a motorcycle! So you're gonna need a few things first:

<li> A motorcycle!</li>
 <li>All your safety gear (cause safety is sexy)</li>
 <li>A place with <strong>*ideally*</strong> little to no traffic</li>
<li>Probably a friend for moral and physical support!</li>
 <li>A "**can-do**" attitude</li>
<li><s>A way to contact the Hospital</s> nevermind, <br />
  I'm sure you'll be fine</li>
</body>


<p> Now that we've got all our essential materials, let's take <br />
  a look at the controls and clusters of a motorcycle and <br />
  a few other key parts.<p>

<p> Ok! The first and most important step of riding a motorcycle <br />
  is checking to make sure it is safe to ride!<br />
<p>Here is a table that you can use for a reference when doing a pre-ride<br />
  inspection<p>

  <html>
     <head>
        <style>
           table, th, td {
              border: 2px solid red;
              border-collapse: collapse;
              }
        </style>
  </style>
     </head>
     <body>
        <table>
           <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th scope="col">Chain</th>
              <th scope="col">Oil</th>
              <th scope="col">Tires</th>
           </tr>
           <tr>
              <th scope="row">OK TO RIDE</th>
              <td>lubed, no damage, correct slack</td>
              <td>good color, between fill lines</td>
              <td>good tread, rounded, no cracks</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
              <th scope="row">NOT OK TO RIDE</th>
              <td>damaged, too loose or tight, no lube/rust</td>
              <td>dark, not between fill lines</td>
              <td>cracked, squared off, low tread</td>
           </tr>
        </table>
     </body>

<p>   If everything looks good you can stick your key in the ignition. <br />
  The cluster should light up or move.<p>

<p>Now that the bike is on, we should check to make sure that it is in <br />
  Neutral. This can be determined almost universally by looking for <br />
   a **Green** light. If you **DO NOT** see a **Green** light, chances are <br />
   you're engaged in a gear. To put the bike in Neutral, squeeze the <br />
   clutch lever and press down on the shift lever until it will go down <br />
   no more. Then, you will apply soft pressure to the shift lever in the <br />
   opposite direction (up) just once, and a green light should appear.
<p>So, now you are in Neutral, let's put the bike into 1<sub>st</sub> gear.
  To do <br /> this just squeeze the clutch lever once more and press the <br />
  shift lever back down until you hear/feel a heavy "*clunk*" sound. <br />
  This means that the bike is in 1<sub>st</sub> gear and you are ready to ride.<br />
  <P> **ALWAYS KEEP THE CLUTCH SQUEEZED WHEN IN 1ST GEAR** <br />
    or the bike will stall!
  <p> The next step is the trickiest of all. It will take lots of practice<br />
    but once you get it, you won't forget it. *Slowly* let the clutch go<br />
    while simaltaneously applying a small amount of throttle (or gas)<br />
    and you should feel the clutch engage, and the rear wheel receiving<br />
    power. By now you should be rolling!!!! As you let out the clutch<br />
    you should continue to apply more throttle until the clutch is fully<br />
    engaged.
    <p>Now that you're rolling, you'll need to shift eventually. In order <br />
      to shift, you need to monitor the RPM's on the Tachometer.<br />
  Whenever the needle on the tachometer gets close to the red rev<br />
  limiter, you will need to shift. In order to shift up a gear, you <br />
  will *quickly* close the throttle (disengage it) and squeeze <br />
  the clutch at the same time. Once the clutch is completely <br />
  disengaged (squeezed) you need to push the shift lever **UP** <br />
  with your foot just one time. Now you should be in 2<sub>nd</sub> gear!<br />
  <p> Alright, by now you are cruising. you officially know how to start <br />
    and move a motorcycle! I guess it would be important to know how<br />
    to stop as well? We can save that for another day :p
    <p>What? I told you this would be the most basic course.
      <p> Thanks for reading and best of luck out there! Please<br />
        learn from an actual teacher and only use this page as <br /> a
        secondary resource. Happy riding and safe travels.
        <p>  <q>fingers crossed, metaphorically of course, you need your fingers to ride</q>
